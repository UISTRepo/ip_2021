# ip_2021
Here is the code from the Internet Programming 2021 tutorials. We are going to upgrade this project every week with new features.

You have two options:
1. Download the .zip file, unpack it and use it
2. Or, clone the git repository. 
  In order to do this you will have to install git on your computer and then clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/UISTRepo/ip_2021`, and then with every new code update you can `git pull`
